# Enterprise GTM Playbook

Practical, field-tested go-to-market frameworks for building enterprise revenue from zero to repeatable.

This repository captures how I approach enterprise GTM as an operator: defining the ICP, structuring discovery, building outbound motions, and creating forecast discipline — with a strong focus on clarity, consistency, and execution.

## What this playbook covers

- Defining and validating an Ideal Customer Profile (ICP)
- Structuring discovery for complex, multi-stakeholder deals
- Building outbound motions with BDR + AE collaboration
- Running deal reviews and improving win rates
- Forecast hygiene and pipeline discipline
- Where AI can support GTM (and where it shouldn’t)

This is not theory. Everything here is based on real enterprise GTM work across SaaS, AI, and consulting environments.
